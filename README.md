# Movie-Discovery-App
An app created using Kivy framework and the tmbd API. 

App allows users to choose search preferences and then generates a series of movies based on preference input. Users can add movies to a list to refer to later. Users can also add movies to a separate 'bad' list. Movies on the 'bad' list will not be included in any further search results.
